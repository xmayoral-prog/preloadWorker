# Javascript PreLoad

A way to get a file from a server and load in the web browser memory.

Using this technique we can get the file independently of when we need to show

This code reads the file and stores in a blob, this can be done with a “normal” function or using a worker. Also uses promises to “wait” for all the preload files.

Use this code as you want.

Suggestions will be welcome.
